## EconML with R and the `reticulate` package

In this repo you will learn how to call the fantastic [`EconML`](https://github.com/microsoft/EconML) python library from R using the [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) package. In particular, I reproduce two examples that appear in EconML notebooks:

1. Example Usage with Single Continuous Treatment Observational Data (source: [EconML notebook, section 4](https://github.com/microsoft/EconML/blob/master/notebooks/Double%20Machine%20Learning%20Examples.ipynb))  

2. Example Usage with Multiple Continuous Treatment, Multiple Outcome Observational Data (source: [EconML notebook, section 5](https://github.com/microsoft/EconML/blob/master/notebooks/Double%20Machine%20Learning%20Examples.ipynb))
