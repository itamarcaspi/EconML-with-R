## EconML with R and the `reticulate` package

EconML is a Python package for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data via machine learning. In this repo you will learn how to call [`EconML`](https://github.com/microsoft/EconML) from R using the [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) package. 

To this end, I reprodice two examples that appear in the ("Double Machine Learning: Use Cases and Examples")[https://github.com/microsoft/EconML/blob/master/notebooks/Double%20Machine%20Learning%20Examples.ipynb] EconML notebook:

1. [Example Usage with Single Continuous Treatment Observational Data](https://raw.githack.com/itamarcaspi/EconML-with-R/master/single.html) (source: [EconML notebook, section 4](https://github.com/microsoft/EconML/blob/master/notebooks/Double%20Machine%20Learning%20Examples.ipynb))  

2. [Example Usage with Multiple Continuous Treatment, Multiple Outcome Observational Data](https://raw.githack.com/itamarcaspi/EconML-with-R/master/multiple.html) (source: [EconML notebook, section 5](https://github.com/microsoft/EconML/blob/master/notebooks/Double%20Machine%20Learning%20Examples.ipynb))
